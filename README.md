## Agile Methodology

### Overview

Agile methodology is a project management approach that focuses on flexibility, teamwork, and making steady progress toward a clear objective. It is especially effective in software development, where requirements and solutions evolve through the joint efforts of self-organizing, cross-functional teams. Agile methodologies strive to deliver small, incremental product updates that enhance quality and allow for quick adaptation to changing needs.


### MoSCoW Prioritization

The MoSCoW prioritization technique is a framework for assessing the importance of different features and tasks within a project. It classifies items into four categories: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. This approach aids in effective time management by ensuring that the most essential features are prioritized and completed first.

### GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects provides a way to manage tasks and monitor progress using project boards. Each board represents an EPIC, with columns that track the status of tasks, such as To Do, In Progress, On Hold, Done, and Bugs. Tasks are organized with labels indicating the user, priority, and sprint.

![Kanban Board](/docs/readme-md/kanban-board.png)

### EPICS

An Epic is a large segment of work broken down into smaller user stories. In this project, each Epic represents a significant component of the platform's development, ensuring all necessary functionalities are fully covered.

They outline the placement of key elements such as navigation menus, user profiles, content areas, and interactive features. The wireframes ensure a cohesive and intuitive user interface, guiding the design and development process. After the extensive testing was conducted, naturally there are some deviations from wireframes in the live version of the platform.

## Design Choices

### Typography

 [Cabin](https://fonts.google.com/?query=cabin) was chosen as the primary font.
Cabin is a modern serif typeface with calligraphic roots that balances traditional elegance with a contemporary touch. It features slightly rounded letterforms, which give it a friendly and approachable appearance while maintaining excellent readability on both screens and printed materials.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme warm, earthy tones with deep, contrasting hues to create a welcoming and sophisticated ambiance that resonates with book lovers. The palette features a mix of soft neutrals, rich browns, deep blues, and accents of warm shades, reflecting the cozy, intimate feel of a traditional bookstore while maintaining a modern, stylish look.

-   **Warm Neutrals and Earth Tones**: These provide a soft, comfortable backdrop that is easy on the eyes and ideal for extended reading sessions. They evoke feelings of warmth, tranquility, and familiarity, creating an inviting environment for browsing and exploring books.
    
-   **Deep, Rich Accents**: Darker shades add depth and contrast to the design, highlighting key elements such as headings, call-to-action buttons, and important navigation items. These colors ground the palette, providing a sense of structure and sophistication.
    
-   **Cool, Calm Blues**: The inclusion of cooler hues adds balance and a refreshing contrast to the warm tones. These colors convey trustworthiness and reliability, aligning with the bookstore's goal of providing a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience.
    
-   **Subtle Highlights**: Lighter shades are used for backgrounds, cards, and secondary elements to keep the layout light and airy. They help create a clean and uncluttered look, ensuring the content remains the focal point.
    
Overall, this color scheme balances warmth with contrast, creating a visually appealing and comfortable atmosphere that enhances the browsing and reading experience for users.

### Images

Combination of images sourced from [Leonardo](https://leonardo.ai/ "Leonardo AI") and [Amazon](https://amazon.com). All images sourced from Leonardo AI are available under free licenses, allowing for their use in commercial projects without attribution. This ensures compliance with copyright laws and provides assurance regarding the legal usage of the images on the website. The product images were obtained from Amazon. However, this platform will not be producing any financial gains.

### Responsiveness

My website is responsive to different layouts depending on the size of the viewport have been included in the CSS media queries. This allows visitors to experience the website as I intended on device types and screen sizes. The breakpoints I am using are from Bootstrap.

## Security Measures and Protective Design

### User Authentication

- Django's `LoginRequiredMixin` is used to ensure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page.
- Django's `UserPassesTestMixin` is used to limit access based on certain permissions, ensuring users can only edit/delete content they authored. If the user doesn't pass the test, they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

### Password Management

- Use Django's built-in password management tools to ensure passwords are hashed and stored securely.
- Enforce strong password policies to enhance user account security.

### Form Validation

If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit, and a warning will appear to the user informing them which field raised the error.

### Database Security

- The database URL and secret key are stored in the `env.py` file to prevent unwanted connections to the database. This setup was implemented before the first push to GitHub.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens are used on all forms throughout the site to enhance security.

Key components of the Teacup Tales business model include:

This business model enables Teacup Tales to reach a broad audience, minimize overhead costs, and provide an enjoyable, convenient shopping experience for readers around the world.

## Marketing Strategies

### Search Engine Optimisation

To enhance the Teacup Tales visibility and ranking on Google, a comprehensive SEO strategy was developed using [QuestionDB](https://questiondb.io) to identify relevant keywords for meta tags, alt texts, and content elements.

Based on this research, a mix of short and long-tail keywords were selected to target both specific and broad search queries:

-   online bookstore
-   buy books online
-   best online bookshop
-   novels for sale
-   literary gifts
-   children's books online
-   fiction and non-fiction books
-   rare and antique books
-   personalized book recommendations
-   bookshop for book lovers

### SEO Strategies

1.  **Effective Use of Headings:**
    -   Utilize `<span>` for the bookshop title in the header/navigation, and strategically place `<h1>` tags with relevant keywords to enhance keyword prominence.
    -   Incorporate `<h2>` tags for promotional keywords to improve search relevance.
2.  **Keyword Emphasis:**
    -   Use the `<strong>` HTML element to highlight important short and long-tail keywords throughout the content. This not only provides visual emphasis but also signals their semantic importance to search engines.
3.  **Image Optimization:**
    -   Apply keyword-rich and descriptive alt texts and filenames to all images, ensuring they are relevant to the content and improve searchability.
4.  **Optimize External Links:**
    -   Add the `rel="noopener nofollow"` attribute to social media and external links, which prevents search engines from considering these links when evaluating the site's ranking.
    `<p class="socials mt-4">
    <a href="https://github.com/Indre-V" target="_blank" aria-label="GitHub" rel="noopener nofollow">
        <i class="fa fa-github icon mx-3 fs-2" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61567109754400&sk=about" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook" rel="noopener nofollow">
        <i class="fa fa-facebook icon mx-3 fs-2" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/indre-vilickaite/" target="_blank" aria-label="LinkedIn" rel="noopener nofollow">
        <i class="fa fa-linkedin-square icon mx-3 fs-2" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="mailto:teacuptalesbooks@gmail.com" aria-label="Email Teacup Tales Books Customer Service" rel="noopener nofollow">
        <i class="fa fa-envelope icon mx-3 fs-2" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </a>
</p>
`

5.  **Sitemap Inclusion:**
    -   Generate and include a `sitemap.xml` file to guide search engine crawlers in indexing the site effectively.

6.  **Control Search Engine Crawling:**
    -   Use of `robots.txt` file to manage and control the behavior of search engine bots while they crawl the site.

7. **Template Blocks for Meta Descriptions:**
    - Using `{% block metadesc %}` in Django templates is a good practice for maintaining a clean, organized, and SEO-friendly codebase. It balances flexibility and maintainability while providing a good structure for dynamic content.
    

These strategies will be continuously refined and improved over time, aiming to increase the bookshop's ranking on Google and attract more organic traffic to the website.

### Social Media

Teacup Tales will leverage Facebook as a primary platform for engaging with its audience and promoting its online bookshop. The strategy includes the following key components:

1.  **Content Sharing:**    
    -   Post a variety of content, including book recommendations, new arrivals, promotions, literary news, and behind-the-scenes looks at Teacup Tales. This keeps the audience informed and engaged.
2.  **Community Engagement:**    
    -   Foster a sense of community by encouraging interactions through comments, likes, and shares. Respond promptly to customer inquiries and feedback to build relationships and trust.
3.  **Promotional Campaigns:**    
    -   Run targeted ad campaigns to reach potential customers based on their interests, demographics, and browsing behavior. Highlight special offers, book sales, and exclusive events to drive traffic to the website.
4.  **Events and Announcements:**
    -   Use Facebook Events to promote book launches, author signings, and other special events. Keep followers updated on important announcements and store news.
5.  **User-Generated Content:**    
    -   Encourage customers to share their reading experiences, reviews, and photos with Teacup Tales products. Feature user-generated content to build credibility and create a more personal connection with the audience.
6.  **Analytics and Insights:**    
    -   Monitor Facebook Insights to track the performance of posts, ads, and overall engagement. Use this data to refine the strategy, optimize content, and improve outreach efforts.

By focusing on these elements, Teacup Tales will effectively utilize Facebook to enhance brand visibility, engage with readers, and drive traffic to its online bookshop.

### Newsletter Marketing

Teacup Tales will use Mailchimp to manage and send newsletters to keep subscribers updated and engaged. Hereâ€™s how it will work:

1.  **Build Subscriber List:**    
    -   Collect email addresses through sign-up forms on the website and social media. Organize subscribers into groups for targeted messaging.

4.  **Automate Emails:**    
    -   Set up automated emails to welcome new subscribers, thank customers after purchases, and send personalized book suggestions.
5.  **Track Results:**    
    -   Monitor how newsletters perform with Mailchimpâ€™s reports on open rates, clicks, and other key metrics. Use this information to improve future emails.
6.  **Test and Personalize:**

### AWS Cloud Service

Teacup Tales uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store static and media files securely in the cloud, ensuring fast and reliable access for our users.

2.  **Create an S3 Bucket:**
    
    -   Search for "S3" in the AWS Management Console and create a new bucket.
    -   Name the bucket to match your Heroku app name and select the region closest to your target audience.
3.  **Set Public Access and Ownership:**
    
    -   Uncheck the "Block all public access" option and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for compatibility with Heroku).
    -   Under "Object Ownership," ensure "ACLs enabled" and "Bucket owner preferred" are selected.
4.  **Enable Static Website Hosting:**
    
    -   In the "Properties" tab, enable static website hosting.

    -   In the "Permissions" tab, add the following CORS configuration:
    
    json
    
    Copy code
    
    `[
      {
        "AllowedHeaders": ["Authorization"],
        "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
        "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
      }
    ]` 
    
    -   Copy your bucket's **ARN** (Amazon Resource Name).

6.  **Add a Bucket Policy:**
    
    -   Go to the "Bucket Policy" tab and click on the "Policy Generator" link.
    -   Configure the policy:
        -   **Policy Type:** S3 Bucket Policy
        -   **Effect:** Allow

    json
    
    Copy code
    
    ```{
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": "*",

Proper configuration ensures that your content is readily accessible while adhering to best practices in cloud security and management.

### Stripe

Teacup Tales utilizes Stripe as its primary payment gateway to securely process e-commerce transactions. Stripe provides a reliable and scalable solution for handling payments, ensuring a seamless checkout experience for our customers.

1.  **Create a Stripe Account:**
    
    -   Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and create an account. Log in to your Stripe dashboard.
2.  **Obtain API Keys:**

    -   Retrieve the following keys:
        -   **STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY**: Your Publishable Key (starts with `pk`)
        -   **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY**: Your Secret Key (starts with `sk`)
    -   These keys will be used to authenticate your application with Stripe.
3.  **Configure Webhooks for Payment Events:**
    
    -   To handle scenarios where a user may close the payment page prematurely, set up Stripe Webhooks to receive real-time payment updates.
    -   In your Stripe dashboard:
        -   Navigate to "Developers" and select "Webhooks."
        -   Click "Add Endpoint."
        -   Enter your endpoint URL (e.g., `https://teacup-tales.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`).
        -   Select "Receive all events" to capture all relevant payment events.
        -   Click "Add Endpoint" to complete the process.
    -   This will generate a new key:
